# üî• Flame7Years Contribution Simulation üî•

This project is my submission for the #Flame7Years contest organized by [Blue Fire OSS](https://x.com/BlueFireOSS). The contest celebrates Flame's 7th anniversary by inviting participants to create an animation of a flame using the Flame engine without any assets. ü•≥

## üîç About the Project

This simulation visualizes the contributions of the [top 100 contributors](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/graphs/contributors) to the [Flame Engine](https://flame-engine.org) project over the past seven years. Each fire orb represents the contribution amount for a specific month, with its size corresponding to the actual data pulled from GitHub up to 2024-10-22. The contributors "keep the flame alive" by throwing fire orbs into the Flame logo, symbolizing the ongoing support and contributions of the community. üî•
